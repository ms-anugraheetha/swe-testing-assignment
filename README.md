# \## Testing Framework Research

# 

# This project uses pytest. Two common Python testing frameworks are unittest and pytest.

# 

# unittest is Python’s built-in testing framework. It is stable and widely used but requires more boilerplate code and is less readable.

# 

# pytest is more modern and easier to use. It requires less code, has better output, and automatically discovers tests. It also supports advanced features like fixtures and parameterization.

# 

# pytest was chosen because it is simpler, faster, and more suitable for small and medium projects.
